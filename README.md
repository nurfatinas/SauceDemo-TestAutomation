# SauceDemo: Test Automation Framework (WIP)


Hi There! 

This project documents my journey in learning Selenium with Java and showcases a robust test automation framework designed for www.saucedemo.com.

SauceDemo is a sample e-commerce web application, providing users with the opportunity to explore and interact with various features commonly found on an online shopping website.


Please take note that this project is currently under construction and will be subject to ongoing updates. Feel free to examine the codebase and inform me of any possible enhancements.

Thanks!
