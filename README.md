# SauceDemo: Test Automation Framework (WIP)


Hi There! 

This project documents my journey in learning Selenium with Java and showcases a robust test automation framework designed for www.saucedemo.com.

SauceDemo is a sample e-commerce web application, providing users with the opportunity to explore and interact with various features commonly found on an online shopping website.

The framework is structured with a keen focus on modularity, maintainability, and versatility.

## Project Structure

Organized with clarity, the project is divided into separate packages for essential components:

## Key Features

### Page Object Model (POM)

The framework leverages the Page Object Model for creating maintainable and modular code. Each web page is represented by a distinct class within the `Pages` package, encapsulating elements and associated actions.

### Test Cases

The test suite encompasses positive and negative test cases, showcasing the framework's versatility. TestNG is employed for effective test case management and execution.

### Data-Driven Testing

Proficiency in data-driven testing is demonstrated by reading test data from external sources such as Json and Excel files. This allows the same test case to run with different sets of input data, enhancing test coverage.

### Logging and Reporting

To improve traceability and comprehension, the project incorporates logging to capture important events and information during test execution. Additionally, a robust reporting mechanism, such as Extent Reports, is integrated to generate comprehensive and visually appealing test reports.

## Test Scripts

You can find the manual test scripts that I wrote in [SauceDemo Test Scripts.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10LuKWl6Zu-VmP7f06Y-976lba1XM7Zjb7WT17w1uurE/edit?usp=sharing)
